# Dataset
In order to train main road vehicles in dense traffic environments, we extracted over 500000 following segments that meet the requirements of dense traffic scenarios from three public traffic datasets. Based on this, we trained and obtained the micro interaction behavior of main road vehicles mentioned in this article.

Each data sample contains information about the ego vehicle, the preceding vehicle, the merging adjacent vehicle, and the lane markings. Each vehicle is represented by an 11-dimensional vector, which corresponds to the following parameters in order: vehicle's x-coordinate, vehicle's y-coordinate, vehicle's heading angle, vehicle's lateral velocity, vehicle's longitudinal velocity, vehicle's lateral acceleration, vehicle's longitudinal acceleration, total acceleration, steering angle, distance to the preceding vehicle, deviation from the lane center, vehicle type label, and vehicle length.
